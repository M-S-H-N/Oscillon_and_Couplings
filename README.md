# Oscillon_and_Couplings
This repository contains files related to the study of formation and decay of oscillons in the presence of an external coupling in $\alpha$-attractor T-models and E-models. A large portion of the data stored in this repository has been generated using the publicly available lattice simulation cde  CosmoLattice.
